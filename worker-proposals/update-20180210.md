Make no mistake, this proposal is ambitious. It is a departure from historic norms in scope, duration
and budget: a dedicated development **team**, for the **calendar year** and a budget near
**$2M bitUSD**. Contributors to this proposal and participants on the initial Core Team are
demonstrated leaders within this community and ready now to move BitShares development forward.
