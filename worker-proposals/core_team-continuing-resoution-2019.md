=======================================================

Intent
======

* Establish a _short-term_ **budget** to sustain the development efforts of the BitShares Core Team
until a _full-year_ budget is negotiated
* Continue **funding efforts** based on 
[Core Team 2018 Budget](https://www.bitshares.foundation/workers/2018-03-bitshares-core) scope and 
rate

Background
==========

The BitShares Core Team was established in 2018 to deliver protocol enhancements and maintain the
project for the decentralized autonomous community (DAC). The funding mechanism and scope for the 
2019 Core Team Budget remain in active review and require additional time to finalize, communicate 
to the Community and allow time for proper voting. This _continuing resolution_ allows the Core 
Team to continue its primary development efforts and negotiate a new worker proposal for 2019.

Worker
======

This is a Budget Worker Proposal which provides funding through January 2019 for:
* BitShares Core Team Roles
* Collaboration Tools
* Development Initiatives
Please refer to the 
[Core Team 2018 Budget](https://www.bitshares.foundation/workers/2018-03-bitshares-core) for details 
thereof.

Duration and Pay
================

This proposal will last for approximately 31 days, starting from 1st January thru 31st January 2019.

Payments:
* Invoices from Core Team Members will be submitted to the Coordinator by Monday 12:00 UTC for work
performed thru Sunday 23:59 UTC of the previous period
* Coordinator will review and approve submitted time sheets, then forward an invoice to BitShares
Blockchain Foundation for release of funds from escrow to `"bitsharesdev"` account for remittance to
contributors
* Coordinator will review and approve all team member invoices, then forward to BitShares Blockchain
Foundation for direct remittance

Calculation:
* Use bitCNY rather than bitUSD due to current market state
* 3.596 BTS/bitCNY = Settlement price of bitCNY at the moment of writing (2018-12-30)
* 2.5 = Collateral multiplier to cover market fluctuations and borrow with 2.5x collateral, as needed
* 2018 budget daily budget was $2,421 USD/day ≈≈ 16,656 CNY/day 
* 16,656 CNY * 3.596 BTS/CNY * 2.5 collateral multiplier ≈ 149,737 BTS/day

All remittances will be in bitCNY with method developed by the BitShares Blockchain Foundation [5].``
